Each log file contains a 4-byte magic number, followed by a set of events that describe data modifications:
0xfe 0x62 0x69 0x6e
event(The header bytes provide information about the type of event, when it was generated, by which server, and so forth; The data bytes provide information specific to the type of event, such as a particular data modification.)
The first event is a descriptor event that describes the format version of the file (the format used to write events in the file).
The remaining events are interpreted according to the version.
The final event is a log-rotation event that specifies the next binary log filename.
//format description log event
struct FormatDescriptionLogEvent {
  uint32_t created;
  uint16_t binlog_version;
  char server_version[50];
  uint8_t common_header_len;
  uint8_t post_header_len;
  uint8_t server_version_split[3];
  uint8_t number_of_event_types;

};
